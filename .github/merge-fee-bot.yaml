    Hi! In order to compensate for the efforts of processing PRs, we kindly ask for a contribution.
    ðŸ’€ As **there is no refund**, before **paying the fee**, make sure **new tokens fulfill the minimum circulation and other [acceptance criteria](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863)**.
    See also the [PR Fee FAQ](https://developer.trustwallet.com/add_new_asset/pr-fee).
    \nPlease pay  **$PAY1_AMOUNT $PAY1_CURRENCY**  with the memo **$PAY1_MEMO**  to the address `$PAY1_ADDRESS`.
    Alternatively, $PAY2_AMOUNT $PAY2_CURRENCY is also accepted (same memo & address).

    \n*Notes*:
    * [Trust Wallet Tokens (TWT)](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/trust-wallet-token-twt/4187) can be obtained through our [Referral Program](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/invite-a-friend-earn-trust-wallet-token-twt/4125) or [from DEXs/exchanges](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/where-to-get-trust-wallet-tokens/76641).
    * New tokens without significant usage are rejected, see criteria mentioned above.
    * One PR should be for a single project; PR's with more than 10 logos will be rejected.
    * Payment evaluation happens automatically, but with a few minutes delay.  When payment is detected, an Accept Review is automatically placed on the PR, which is a condition for merge.
    * Evaluating the PR is done manually, and it is merged only if all conditions are satisfied.
    * TWT-BEP2 is supported (Binance Chain), TWT-BEP20 version on Smart Chain is not.
